### Hi, I'm Nick. I blog what I learn. 

With an insatiable appetite for bugs, I explore programming, software quality, and cybersecurity in everyday life.

> Fun Fact: I'm deaf and spent 4 years as a Software Quality Analyst working as a Federal contractor. Iâ€™ve completed an OSCP online course and am looking forward to taking the exam soon!
